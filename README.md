# Unhandled Error in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where POST requests are not properly handling invalid or missing data in the request body.  The bug showcases a missing error handling mechanism, leading to potential crashes or unexpected responses. The solution provides robust error handling to prevent these issues.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js server that handles a POST request to the `/user` endpoint. It attempts to create a new user based on the data in the request body. However, it lacks error handling for cases where the request body is invalid or missing required fields. This could lead to exceptions being thrown if the server receives a malformed request.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the improved code with proper error handling.  The solution includes checks for the existence and validity of required fields in the request body. If the data is invalid, it sends an appropriate error response, preventing server crashes and providing informative feedback to the client.
